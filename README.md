# Abstract
User stories (USs) are a widely used notation for requirements in agile development. 
However, it can easily happen that two USs are redundant, at least partially. 
While some form of redundancy may be acceptable, the user should keep an eye on redundancy in USs for the sake of conciseness and to reduce the risk of inconsistencies.
We present two different approaches to analysing USs for redundancy and compare their potential and limitations.
The first approach translates annotated USs into graph transformation rules, which are then analysed for conflicts to infer redundancies.
The second approach uses a large language model (LLM), here *GPT*, to analyse annotated USs for redundancy. 
We compare the results of these redundancy analyses and discuss their similarities and differences. 
We found that the graph transformation (GT)-based approach is particularly suitable for syntactic analysis, whereas the LLM-based approach seems to find semantic redundancies.

## Redundancy Detection with LLMs
Redundant requirements can be paired and between this pairs redundancies can be found. 

We use the User Stories from [nlp-stories](https://github.com/ace-design/nlp-stories/tree/main) and [user story repo](https://zenodo.org/records/8136975) 
We compared our LLM approach against a formal approach from [Alexander Lauer, Amir Rabieyan Nejad, Lukas Hofmann](https://github.com/amirrabieyannejad/USs_Annotation.git)

## Env.
You have to create an *.env*-file in the *src* folder. The following entries have to be considered:
- OPENAI_API_KEY (Enter here your API key)
- MODEL_VERSION (GPT 3.5 = gpt-3.5-turbo points to gpt-3.5-turbo-0125, GPT-4o = gpt-4o-2024-05-13)
- TPM (Tokens-Per-Minute)
- RPM (Requests-Per-Minute)
- TOKEN_DELTA (Approximation of the Request Size to avoid GPT "Deadlocks")
- TEMPERATURE (e.g. 0.2)
- OUTPUT_EXCEL_NAME_WITH_JUST_TEXT (Insert here the name of the .xlsx-file which stores the results of results from without annoations)
- OUTPUT_EXCEL_NAME_WITH_ANNOTATIONS (Insert here the name of the .xlsx-file which stores the results of results from with annoations)
- OUTPUT_EXCEL_NAME_WITH_TEXT_AND_ANNOTATIONS (Insert here the name of the .xlsx-file which stores the results of results from with plain annoations)
- THRESHOLD_REPAIR (Any number of repairs, e.g., "3")
- THREADING ("1" = ON, "2" = OFF)
- THREAD_MULTIPLICATOR (Any number for thread multiplication > 0)
- LIMIT  ("-1" =None, "n" = any number)
