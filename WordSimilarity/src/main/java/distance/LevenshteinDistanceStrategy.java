     * Calculates a normalized distance score between two strings using a dynamic programming approach.
     * This method implements a variation of the Levenshtein distance algorithm, which measures the minimum number
     * of single-character edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) required to change one word into the other.
     * The distance is then normalized by the maximum length of the two input strings to provide a relative measure of similarity.
     *
     * The normalization ensures that the score is scaled between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates no difference (the strings are identical),
     * and 1 indicates the maximum possible distance relative to the length of the longer string.
     *
     * The cost of substitution is determined by the `costOfSubstitution` method, which needs to be defined to use
     * this method correctly. This allows for customization based on specific character changes.
     *
     * @param word1 the first string to compare; should not be null and should represent text data.
     * @param word2 the second string to compare; should not be null and should represent text data.
     * @return a double value representing the normalized edit distance, scaled such that 1 represents identical strings
     * and 0 represents the maximum difference.
