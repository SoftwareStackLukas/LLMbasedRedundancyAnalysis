The main part and benefit redundancies are disjoint, therefore a benefit redundancy can exist while a main part redundancy does not exist or exists. This array details redundancies found in the benefits described by the User Story pairs. This array is mandatory to be filled when the field 'redundantBenefit' is true.  \n",
