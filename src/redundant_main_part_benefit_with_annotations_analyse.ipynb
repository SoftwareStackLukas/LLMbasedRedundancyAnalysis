      "Act as a Requirements Engineer focused on identifying redundancies. Please review pairs of two User Stories and pinpoint any unnecessary duplications that obscure clarity or add no distinct value.\n",
      "As a requirements engineer in agile development, it is my responsibility to review user stories for redundancies. My goal is to identify and report any overlapping or duplicate requirements. By carefully analysing the user stories in depth, I ensure that each requirement is necessary and contributes uniquely, increasing the coherence of the product.\n",
      "Please, analyse redundancies in the main part and benefit of a pair of two given User Stories Note that a User Story may include multiple redundancies in the main part as well as the benefit. The redundancies of the main part and benefit are disjoint sets. Hence, a main part can be redundant while a benefit is not and vice versa. However, in some cases the main part and the benefit can be at the same time redundant, but they do not depend on each other and therefore they are independent redundant. The definition of the main part is: \"The main part of a User Story describes the core action that a persona wishes to accomplish. For example, the main part of the user story 'As a UI designer, I want to begin user testing, so that I can validate stakeholder UI improvement requests' is 'As a UI designer, I want to begin user testing'. This part specifies the main functionality or feature the story aims to deliver.\" and the definition of a benefit is as follows: \"A benefit in a User Story refers to the positive outcome or advantage that a user or stakeholder gains from the functionality described in the User Story. It directly addresses user needs and enhances the value of the software product, providing a clear motive for the user action, like easing a task or improving efficiency. We use the example from before which was 'As a UI designer, I want to begin user testing, so that I can validate stakeholder UI improvement requests'. Here we determine the benefit part, which is 'so that I can validate stakeholder UI improvement request'. Hence, a benefit starts with the phrase 'so that'.\"\n",
      "I will analyse redundancies in the main parts and benefits of two User Stories. Each story might include multiple redundancies. The main part typically describes the desired functionality by the persona, while the benefit details the positive outcomes from the functionality.\n",
      "Please analyse the User Stories considering the general definition of redundancy: Redundancy in a User Story refers to the unnecessary repetition or duplication of information within the story's description. Such redundancies can cloud the core purpose or value of the feature, leading to potential confusion or misinterpretation by the development team. It's crucial to remove redundancies to maintain clarity and focus in development. Additionally, take into account the specific redundancy in the main part: \"A main part redundancy in User Stories refers to unnecessary duplication in the description of the action or functionality that the persona aims to achieve, excluding persona repetitions and benefits. This type of redundancy occurs when similar actions or functionalities are described in multiple stories without adding distinct value or clarity, potentially leading to confusion or inefficiencies in the development process. Thus, a main part redundancy occurs when a pair of two User Stories have a redundant main part.\" and the redundancy in benefits: \"Benefit redundancy in User Stories occurs when multiple stories repeatedly emphasize the same positive outcomes of similar software features. This duplication can lead to inefficiencies as the same advantages are stated multiple times, potentially diluting the impact and clarity of user benefits in the product documentation. Thus, a benefit redundancy occurs when a pair of two User Stories have a redundant benefit part.\" Can you do that?\n",
